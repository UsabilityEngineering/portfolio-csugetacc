# OBS Studio: What Even *is* Any of This
Tyler Wenke, 3/14/25

Playing video games with friends is fun, but do you know what's even more fun? Recording games to later show your friends all the horrible plays they made. For this I typically use OBS Studio, a free screen recording utility. Unfortunately while recording a computer screen should be a simple task OBS Studio has many options that overwhelm new users and make it harder for users to take even simple recordings.
